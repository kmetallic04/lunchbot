This is a payments callback url written in Javascript and can be run locally for testing, using the Africa's Talking Payment service.

             \(^O^)/ 
******Setting up and Running****** 

1. Set up Node.JS as explained in their official site  

2. (Optional) Set up `Ngrok` as described in this tutorial (https://api.slack.com/tutorials/tunneling-with-ngrok)   

3. In your Africa's Talking payments product dashboard add `https://the-secure-url-of-this-app/lipa` as your callback url. If this was running on `localhost:3000` tunneled as `https://qwerty1.ngrok.io`,my callback url becomes `https://qwerty1.ngrok.io/lipa`

4.  Run the app by executing the following command 
```bash 
$ npm start  
```
